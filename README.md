# Filesortter
Sorts files in given title format.
Done for sorting anime titles on same folder with file structure
[source] name - episode (quality) [checksum].filetype

Usage; either run as .exe and give filepath in cmd line or comment out the current main and edit the debug hardcoded filepath.
Made to sort certain anime files to subfolders.

whatever you do DO NOT run the filesorttime.exe if you have a lot of data to go trough, it is slow. (ca. 5minutes for ~40gb of data)


Note. The program is as is. works for me but i do not take any responsibility of it working or not working on your machine.
